Nice work on a submission that passes all the tests.

Feedback for code quality/design (1.15/1.25):
- There is a fair bit of duplicated/similar code throughout your project- you should try to consolidate this (perhaps using helper functions and loops). It somewhat makes sense in this case, since you do need to hard code a fair bit, but you can compact it, and you should ideally be hardcoding this stuff into ‘final’ variables at the top of your file - leave all the ugliness well out of sight.
- You can often simplify if...return true, else...return false statements, in fact IntelliJ can do this for you.
- Fantastic JavaDoc and commenting
- In terms of style, this is a great project. In terms of organization and OOP principles, this is a great project.
- Remove FIXMEs when you’ve fixed it (implemented the method).
- Overall, this is a really great start to Assignment 2 and sets you up well for the rest of the project. The only improvement would be in compacting your solutions - you can often write helper functions, loops, use other datatypes etc. to achieve this end. Get smart, get lazy!

Git usage (0.25/0.25):
- Frequent commits, though some of your commit messages could be more informative (e.g. 'task 3'). Overall very good use of git from most of your members.

Viewer (1.25/1.25):
- Fantastic viewer. Really impressed that you managed to get the flashing knights working. In terms of visual design, you might want to consider using some more diversity colour-wise, making it easy to differentiate between different kinds of structures, as well as which knights have been used and which haven’t
- Good use of final variables to make it easier to change the visual formatting later.
