Tips:

1. For a resource that you want to reroll, left-click it and it will automatically move to the reroll region. On the contrary, right-click it to cancel it from the reroll region and it will automatically move back to its original position.

2. You can choose 0~6 items to reroll. After rerolling twice, begin doing "build, trade, or swap" using your current 6 resources.

3. Build: Considering the resource you have, the system will automatically give you hints about which structure(s) is(are) able to be built at this moment, which will shine with light green.

4. Settlement, City, and Knight must be built in order of increasing points value.

5. If you build NO structure during a turn, you will get a penalty of -2 points for that turn, added to the running score.

6. Trade: 2 golds for 1 other resource.

7. Swap: A Knight can be used only one time during the whole game. The knight which is built and unused will be shining yellow; The knight which is already exhausted will be fixed dark red.
