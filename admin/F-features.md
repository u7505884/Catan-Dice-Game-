## Player instructions

Tips:

Add Multiple Players

	Players can only add multiple new players at the beginning of the game. (If we add a new player when any player has started their game,  the process will lost.)

Roll Dice

	1. For a resource that you want to reroll, drag it into the dice roller. Or left-click then it will automatically move to the reroll region. 

	2. On the contrary, if we want to remove the dices that have been placed in the roller, we just need to right-click it and it will automatically move back to its original position.

Build Structures

	1. The system will automatically give you hints about which structure(s) is(are) able to be built at this moment, which will shine in yellow.

	2. To build structures, click the board's components directly. 

Swap

	1. The knight which is built and unused will be shining red

	2. The knight which is already used will be fixed green.

	3. Click the shining red knight if you want to swap with them.
